    <section class="section"><h2>About Iction Campuses</h2>
      <p>Iction Campuses was founded on the conviction that education must evolve to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world. Traditional educational models — built for an industrial economy — are insufficient for preparing students to succeed in the knowledge economy, the gig economy, and the creative economy that define the 21st century.</p>
      <p>Our approach reimagines every aspect of the educational experience. We've redesigned physical spaces to promote collaboration and creativity. We've rebuilt curricula around competency-based progression rather than seat time. We've integrated technology not as an add-on but as a fundamental element of how students learn, create, and demonstrate mastery.</p>
      <p>The result is a learning environment that's more engaging, more relevant, and more effective at preparing students for the challenges and opportunities they'll face after graduation. Our graduates enter the workforce with not just knowledge, but the critical thinking, communication, and adaptability skills that employers value most.</p></section>
